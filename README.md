# IBM HR Employee Attrition – SQL Data Analysis

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using SQL. The dataset, provided by IBM, contains various employee-related features such as job role, age, salary, satisfaction level, and attrition status. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and trends that help understand why employees leave the company and identify key areas to improve retention.

# Dataset
# Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset

# Tools Used

Database: PostgreSQL

Interface: pgAdmin

Language: SQL 

# Findings

Job roles such as Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician showed higher attrition rates.

Employees with less than 3 years of experience at the company were more likely to leave.

Departments like Sales had higher attrition compared to Research & Development.

Low job satisfaction and lack of career growth (e.g., low promotions, low salary hike) correlated with higher attrition.

# Conclusion
This SQL-based analysis helped surface key drivers of employee attrition within IBM’s sample dataset. These insights can guide targeted HR strategies aimed at employee retention and satisfaction.
